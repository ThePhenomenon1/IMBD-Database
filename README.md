# IMBD-Database
Creating your own dataset. This is fundamental Data Science. We execute this Data Science project by scraping multiple pages of data from the Internet Movie Database (IMDB) website, in a single script, to fetch IMDB's top 100 movies metadata. We utilize the software packages Beautiful Soup4 and requests. 

Incidentally, the requests library is integral if you want to build a pure Django Application Programming Interface (API).

This is the targeted metadata:
    
 1. Movie Name 
 2. Release Year
 3. Watch Time 
 4. IMDb Rating
 5. Metascore
 6. Votes
 7. Gross Collection
 8. Description
